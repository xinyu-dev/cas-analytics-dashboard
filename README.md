# cas-analytics-dashboard
A Analytics Dashboard built by Python Dash for Chinese Antibody Society's multimedia platforms

# Data Collection
All data collection was done through API except for WeChat (authorization for WeChat API requires a special type of account).

Note: 
- `data` folder is NOT included in the repository, and certain API keys (e.g. mapbox) or sensitive data is hidden for privacy reasons. 
- The original dashboard requires password access, therefore only the screenshots are shown here. 
- The `application.py` is the exactly the source code used to create the dashboard, except that API keys are removed.
